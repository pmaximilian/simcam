###SimCam Software Development Kit v0.0.1
- A cross-platform runtime service library. Built-in P2P Interface Bridge to transform complex P2P communication process into more general interfaces
- A set of RESTful API interfaces for controlling SimCam. Get live and playback media stream through RTSP.
- Built-in interface documentation and dashboard for interface debugging. We will provide a series of source code to demonstrate how to use a few lines of python code to interact with SimCam and how to develop web applications for SimCam.
